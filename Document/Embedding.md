# How to embedding to my project?

All functions have an association with `NetScheduler`. 
So if you want to use part of `Koromo Copy` you must use these dependencies.

`Koromo Copy` only requires two function calls.
There are no additional requirements beyond this.

``` cs
AppProvider.Initialize();

//
//  Coding your own logic.
//

AppProvider.Deinitialize();
```

Enjoy Koromo Copy!
